India CPI Inflation Case Study – Excel Project

Project Overview
This project analyzes India’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation using Microsoft Excel. The analysis focuses on category-wise contribution to inflation, food inflation volatility, Covid-19 impact, and the relationship between global crude oil prices and domestic inflation trends. All calculations, charts, and insights are created using Excel formulas, pivot tables, and charts only.

Role: Data Analyst (Project Owner)
Tools Used: Microsoft Excel

Business Objective
The objective of this project is to help economic and business stakeholders understand the key drivers of inflation in India. The analysis simplifies complex CPI data to highlight which categories contribute most to inflation, how inflation patterns changed during and after Covid-19, and how external factors like crude oil prices influence domestic inflation.

Dataset
CPI Inflation Data
Monthly CPI index values for multiple categories including Food, Essentials, Healthcare, Clothing, Premium, and Miscellaneous. The data includes general CPI indices along with rural and urban breakdowns, sourced from official Government of India publications.

Crude Oil Prices Data
Month-on-month imported crude oil price data from 2021 to 2023, maintained in a separate Excel range for correlation analysis.

Steps Performed in Excel

Data Preparation
Imported CPI index data into Excel and organized it into structured tables
Grouped detailed CPI items into broader analytical buckets such as Food, Essentials, Healthcare, Clothing, Premium, and Miscellaneous
Created helper columns for month-on-month change, year-on-year change, and pre-Covid and post-Covid classification using Excel formulas

Calculations and Analysis
Calculated category-wise contribution to total inflation for the latest available period, ensuring contributions sum to 100 percent
Computed year-on-year inflation trends from 2017 onwards to identify peak inflation years and key drivers
Analyzed month-on-month food inflation from June 2022 to May 2023 to identify highest and lowest inflation months
Compared inflation behavior before and after Covid-19 across Food, Healthcare, and Essentials categories
Performed correlation analysis between crude oil price changes and inflation in Food and Essentials using Excel correlation formulas

Charts and Dashboard
Column chart showing inflation changes before and after Covid-19 for Food, Healthcare, and Essentials
Line chart displaying year-on-year CPI inflation trend from 2017 onwards
Column chart illustrating month-on-month food inflation changes from June 2022 to May 2023
Pie chart representing contribution of major CPI categories to total inflation

Key Insights
Food inflation contributes nearly half of total CPI inflation, accounting for approximately 49 to 50 percent
Essentials contribute around 19 percent to overall inflation
The highest month-on-month food inflation increase occurred in June 2022, while the lowest was observed in February 2023
Spices recorded a sharp inflation spike of around 16.5 percent due to supply constraints and export demand
Overall inflation peaked around 2019 at approximately 7.7 percent, largely driven by food categories
Global crude oil prices show a strong positive correlation with inflation in Food and Essentials between 2021 and 2023
