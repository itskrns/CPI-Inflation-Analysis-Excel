<h2>India CPI Inflation Case Study – Excel Project</h2>

PROJECT OVERVIEW<br>
This project analyzes India’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation using Microsoft Excel. The analysis focuses on category-wise contribution to inflation, food inflation volatility, Covid-19 impact, and the relationship between global crude oil prices and domestic inflation trends. All calculations, charts, and insights are created using Excel formulas, pivot tables, and charts only.

ROLE AND TOOLS

- Role: Data Analyst (Project Owner)
- Tools: Microsoft Excel

BUSINESS OBJECTIVE

- Understand key drivers of CPI inflation in India
- Identify major contributing categories to overall inflation
- Compare inflation behavior before and after Covid-19
- Analyze the impact of global crude oil prices on domestic inflation

DATASET

CPI INFLATION DATA

- Monthly CPI index values across categories such as Food, Essentials, Healthcare, Clothing, Premium, and Miscellaneous
- Includes general CPI index with rural and urban breakdowns
- Source: Official Government of India publications

CRUDE OIL PRICES DATA

- Month-on-month imported crude oil price data from 2021 to 2023
- Maintained separately in Excel for correlation analysis

STEPS PERFORMED IN EXCEL

DATA PREPARATION

- Imported CPI index data into Excel and organized it into structured tables
- Grouped detailed CPI items into broader analytical buckets for clarity
- Created helper columns for:
  - Month-on-month change
  - Year-on-year change
  - Pre-Covid and post-Covid classification

CALCULATIONS AND ANALYSIS

- Calculated category-wise contribution to total inflation for the latest period
- Computed year-on-year inflation trends from 2017 onwards
- Analyzed month-on-month food inflation from June 2022 to May 2023
- Compared inflation trends before and after Covid-19 for key categories
- Performed correlation analysis between crude oil price changes and inflation in Food and Essentials

CHARTS AND DASHBOARD

- Column chart comparing inflation before and after Covid-19 for Food, Healthcare, and Essentials
- Line chart showing year-on-year CPI inflation trend from 2017 onwards
- Column chart displaying month-on-month food inflation changes (Jun 2022 – May 2023)
- Pie chart representing contribution of major CPI categories to total inflation

KEY INSIGHTS

- Food inflation contributes nearly half of total CPI inflation (approximately 49–50 percent)
- Essentials contribute around 19 percent to overall inflation
- Highest month-on-month food inflation increase occurred in June 2022
- Lowest month-on-month food inflation was observed in February 2023
- Spices recorded a sharp inflation spike of around 16.5 percent due to supply constraints and export demand
- Overall inflation peaked around 2019 at approximately 7.7 percent, driven largely by food categories
- Global crude oil prices show strong positive correlation with inflation in Food and Essentials (2021–2023)

HOW TO USE THE EXCEL FILE

- Open the Excel workbook and navigate to the dashboard sheet
- Review charts and headline insights in one place
- Use underlying data sheets to adjust time periods, categories, or formulas for deeper analysis
